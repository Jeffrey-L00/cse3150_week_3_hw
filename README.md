# cse3150_week_3_hw

How concepts were used:

Used dynamic memory arrays to allocate memory for student names.

Used pointer parameters in the updateGPA function and dereferenced pointer.

Const was used in functions such as printStudent and averageGPA to not modify the data since we're printing/calculating it.

References were used through the addStudent function to make it able to change the size variable.

Type casting was used to print the average GPA where we needed to display the GPA as an integer rather than a double.

Exceptions were controlled with a try catch block in the main function.

Switch statements, do while loops, and for loops were used to ensure the cases selected, menu displays, iterations, and user inputs were all managed properly.

Memory management was done with dynamic arrays and freeing of memory with delete[].
